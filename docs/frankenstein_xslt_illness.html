      <h1>Theme Analysis: Illness</h1>
      <p>The monster experienced illness when he was trying to figure out how to survive on
         his own. Victor Frankenstein experienced mental illness throughout the novel including
         anxiety and depression.</p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>for I was lifeless, and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>
      <p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for several months</p>
      <p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting
         attentions of my friend could have restored me to life</p>
      <p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and grieved my friend,
         I recovered</p>
      <p>exceedingly ill</p>
      <p>I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me</p>
      <p> I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and
         bone</p>
      <p>Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least pains which I was destined to endure</p>
