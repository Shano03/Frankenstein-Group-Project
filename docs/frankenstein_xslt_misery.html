      <h1>Theme Analysis: Misery</h1>
      <p>Victor experiences misery after losing his loved ones and abandoning his creation.
         He seeks revenge as a way to end his suffering, but seeking revenge only causes more
         tragedy. The monster faces misery after he is repeatedly rejected from society after
         being abandoned by his creator. He was not created evil, but the misery that he experienced
         caused him to be more violent, which led to more misery for Victor. </p>

      <p>bitterness of grief</p>
      <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching
         eyes the church of , its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.</p>
      <p>  inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress
         I had made in the sciences</p>
      <p>What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed
         carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used
         in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not
         exhibit the pain I felt</p>
      <p>feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept</p>
      <p>misfortunes more bitter and irreparable</p>
      <p>“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live?</p>
      <p>sufferings I endured intense</p>
      <p>put an end to my slavery for ever.</p>
      <p>Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes;
         but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.</p>
      <p>desponding and sorrowful</p>
      <p>my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings</p>
      <p>a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to myself.</p>
      <p>I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>
      <p>But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers</p>
      <p>I wished to make the tour of  alone</p>
      <p>Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that
         now torments me.”</p>
      <p>I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell;</p>
