      <p>his dejection never leaves him</p>
      <p>bitterness of grief</p>
      <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching
         eyes the church of , its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.</p>
      <p>  inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress
         I had made in the sciences</p>
      <p>What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed
         carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used
         in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not
         exhibit the pain I felt</p>

      <p>misfortunes more bitter and irreparable</p>
      <p>“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live?</p>
      <p>sufferings I endured intense</p>
      <p>put an end to my slavery for ever.</p>
      <p>Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes;

      <p>my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings</p>
      <p>a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to myself.</p>
      <p>I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>
      <p>But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers</p>
      <p>I wished to make the tour of  alone</p>
      <p>Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that
         now torments me.”</p>
      <p>I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell;</p>
