      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <h1>Victor Frankenstein experiences moments of madness throughout the novel. Due to him neglecting his mental and physical health for several months, he has multiple breakdowns throughout the novel.</h1>
      <p>his eyes have generally an expression of, and even </p>
      <p>sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses
         him</p>
      <p>my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment</p>
      <p>But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed
         by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied
         by his favourite employment.</p>
      <p>Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful
         degree</p>
      <p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable
         to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with
         excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single
         instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed
         aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when
         he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not
         account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter, frightened and astonished
         him.</p>
      <p>“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the
         dreaded spectre glide into the room; “he can tell.—Oh, save me! save me!” I imagined
         that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and fell down in a fit.</p>
      <p>But you are ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit for agitation of any kind.</p>
      <p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
         operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
         victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
         drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could
         not sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>
      <p>but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my
         mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden
         in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly,
         and not relax the impending conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary, were
         extinguished</p>
      <p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were
         the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered
         in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and
         found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception
         of my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had called
         me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>
      <p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone
         that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most miserable, I sank to repose,
         and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.</p>
