      <h1>Theme Analysis: Self-Disgust</h1>
      <p>The monster and Victor both experience self-disgust throughout the novel. The monster
         is disgusted by the way he looks, since he is never accepted into society. Victor
         feels disgust and shame about the creation he made and the consequences that have
         come from it.</p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much
         more, (I persuaded myself) was yet behind</p>
      <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been
         the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse had not mingled its
         bitterness with my other sensations.</p>
      <p>Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat, and
         passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the
         wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
         pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted,
         when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless
         in a scene so beautiful and heavenly, if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh
         and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say,
         I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me
         and my calamities for ever.</p>
      <p>poor, helpless, miserable wretch</p>
      <p>the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence
         again</p>
      <p>‘Hateful day when I received life!’</p>
      <p>my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.</p>
      <p>trembling with passion</p>
