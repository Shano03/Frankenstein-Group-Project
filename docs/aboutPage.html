        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
      <p> The story of Frankenstein is a widely known story that explores many difficult themes such as consequences of creation, guilt, isolation, madness, and more. 
        
        The goal of this project is to answer the following research question: How does Victor Frankenstein's mental state deteriorate over time throughout the novel? 
        We will do so by analyzing the themes of words and phrases throughout the book and how the themes change over time. </p>
        
        <h2>Marking Up The Text</h2>
        <p>We divided the text into sections and each team member read through a section and tagged people, places, and analysis words and phrases. The analysis terms fit into themes that we used to analysis the mental state of Frankenstein. These themes include guilt, isolation, ambition, madness, secrecy, consequences of creation, obsession, worry, self disgust, rage, misery, and illness. </p>
