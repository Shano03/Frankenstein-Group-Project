      <h1>Theme Analysis: Worry</h1>
      <p>Victor Frankenstein worries about the damage that his creation will do. Victor also
         experiences increasing guilt and fear over the consequences of his creation. This
         constant and high anxiety leads to Victor's mental decline throughout the novel. </p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
         agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to
         announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</p>
      <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that
         I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through
         languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment:
         dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become
         a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>
      <p> I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid
         the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did
         not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on,
         although wetted by the rain, which poured from a black and comfortless sky.</p>
      <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise,
         to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
         conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness
         of fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:</p>
      <p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to
         the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived
         at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature
         whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive, and walking about. I
         dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
         Entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted
         up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected
         myself. I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
         open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting
         for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment
         was empty; and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.</p>
      <p>The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes,
         and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised : he at first
         believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity
         with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
         indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p>
      <p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I
         dared not even think?</p>
      <p>When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
         would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms</p>
      <p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which
         I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
         weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
         whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
         of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
         my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
         me.</p>
      <p> My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. </p>
      <p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my
         lips and throat were parched.</p>
      <p>I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some
         signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
         There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained behind.</p>
      <p>As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects
         of what I was now doing.</p>
      <p>I suffered a temporary access of despair.</p>
      <p>perturbed</p>
