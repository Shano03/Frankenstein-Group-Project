      <h1>Theme Analysis</h1>
      <p>Victor Frankenstein isolates himself while obsessing over making his creation. He
         rarely writes to his family while at Ingolstadt, which worries them. He spends several
         days and nights observing corpses decay as research for his project. He neglects his
         own health and wellbeing in pursuit of making this perfect creation, which leads to
         his declining mental and physical health.</p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered from the first
         shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency
         was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, death-like solitude.</p>
      <p>But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no
         mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was
         now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.</p>
      <p>I was dependent on none, and related to none</p>
      <p>man will not associate with me</p>
      <p>How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? </p>
      <p>Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven
         and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
         peace.</p>
      <p>I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain
         alone.</p>
