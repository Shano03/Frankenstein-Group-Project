      <p>You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did</p>
      <p>The world was to me a secret, which I desired to discover</p>
      <p>the more fully I entered into the science, the more exclusively I pursued it for its
         own sake</p>
      <p>scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.</p>
      <p>And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to
         forget those friends who were so many miles absent</p>
      <p>I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings; but I could not tear my
         thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible
         hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to
         my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of
         my nature, should be completed.</p>
      <p>With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony</p>
      <p>I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into
         an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired
         it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation;</p>
      <p>“I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if
         you had been watching for several nights.”</p>
      <p>“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation, that
         I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see: but I hope, I sincerely hope,
         that all these employments are now at an end, and that I am at length free.”</p>
      <p>A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me</p>
      <p>ardour</p>
