      <h1>Theme Analysis: Ambition</h1>
      <p>Victor's ambition is his fatal flaw. His drive and obsession with making new life
         and having control over death leads to his downfall and death, as well as the deaths
         of his family and friends. Frankenstein uses his story as a cautionary tale to warn
         Captain Robert Walton about the dangers of ambition and the consequences that it brings.</p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches
         of physical science</p>
      <p>I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of difficulties</p>
      <p>I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of
         my native country.</p>
      <p>I most eagerly sought</p>
      <p>I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of
         future success.</p>
      <p>yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize</p>
      <p>It had then filled me with a sublime ecstacy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed
         it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.</p>
      <p>I gazed with a kind of wonder</p>
      <p>it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people</p>
      <p>inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable
         qualities were called forth and displayed</p>
      <p>Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience,
         that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have
         added to my wisdom</p>
      <p>I had saved a human being from destruction</p>
      <p>remembered shuddering at the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of
         my hideous enemy,</p>
      <p>But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.</p>
      <p>I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task.</p>
      <p>Never will I omit my search, until he or I perish; and then with what ecstacy shall
         I join my , and those who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and
         horrible pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>I continued with unabated fervour</p>
      <p>ambition</p>
      <p>determined</p>
      <p>ambition</p>
      <p>inexorable</p>
