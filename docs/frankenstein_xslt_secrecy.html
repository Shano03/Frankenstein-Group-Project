      <h1>Theme Analysis: Secrecy</h1>
      <p>Victor Frankenstein withholds the true nature of his research and experiments from
         those around him. He never lets his family know the full extent of his knowledge,
         even when withholding that information hurts them.</p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p> I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
         me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no
         bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so
         often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only
         impress more deeply.</p>
      <p>thought of the dreadful secret</p>
