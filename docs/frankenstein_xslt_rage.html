      <h1>Theme Analysis</h1>
      <p>Both the monster and Victor seek revenge fueled by rage. The monster feels rage due
         to his constant isolation and seeks revenge on the person who created him. Victor
         seeks revenge on the monster due to the rage he felt when the monster murdered his
         family. </p>
      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him, I gnashed
         my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which
         I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred
         and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the
         highest peak of , could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
         to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head, and avenge
         the deaths of  and .</p>
      <p>anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm
         him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.</p>
      <p>“Devil!” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance
         of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! or rather stay, that
         I may trample you to dust! and, oh, that I could, with the extinction of your miserable
         existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”</p>
      <p>“Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance
         for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your creation; come on then,
         that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.”</p>
      <p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can
         arm one being against the existence of another.</p>
      <p>The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant</p>
      <p>I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind</p>
      <p>I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure</p>
      <p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and
         despair.</p>
      <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend,
         to torture and death.</p>
