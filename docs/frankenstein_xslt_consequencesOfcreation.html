      <p>Paradise of my own creation</p>
      <p>I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting
         you, as mine has been.</p>
      <p>how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge</p>
      <p>how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he
         who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.</p>
      <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
         with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion,
         and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His yellow skin
         scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
         black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed
         a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour
         as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight
         black lips.</p>
      <p>but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror
         and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created,
         I rushed out of the room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable
         to compose my mind to sleep. </p>
      <p>I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created.</p>
      <p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
         animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
         he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion,
         it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>
      <p>As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a
         clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A
         flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me;
         its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to
         humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon to whom I
         had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the
         murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became
         convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree
         for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in
         human shape could have destroyed that fair child. He was the murderer! I could not
         doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought
         of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered
         him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of , a hill that
         bounds on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>
      <p>Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage
         and misery; had he not murdered my brother?</p>
      <p>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
         We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
         We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep,
         Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
         It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,</p>
      <p>its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes</p>
      <p>“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the wretched; how then
         must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest
         and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
         annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
         Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If
         you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you
         refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
         remaining friends.”</p>
      <p>I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably
         alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures,
         who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me.</p>
      <p>still more from the barbarity of man</p>
      <p>there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain</p>
      <p>deprecate the vices of mankind</p>
      <p>for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess.</p>
      <p>feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment</p>
      <p>I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the
         ocean.</p>
      <p>I saw the lifeless form of  stretched before me.</p>
      <p>She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down,
         and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.</p>
      <p>He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic
         fit was brought on, and in a few days he died in my arms.</p>
      <p>poverty</p>
