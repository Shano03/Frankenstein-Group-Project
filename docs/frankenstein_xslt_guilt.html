      <h1>Occurrences of Theme</h1>
      <p>During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice, I suffered living torture. It
         was to be decided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause
         the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy;
         the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could
         make the murder memorable in horror.  also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities
         which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious
         grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty
         of the crime ascribed to ; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration
         would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have exculpated
         her who suffered through me.</p>
      <p>I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular
         voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim,
         I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine;
         she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would
         not forego their hold.</p>
      <p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations
         of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
         cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured</p>
      <p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could
         conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The
         poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary between life and death,
         felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony.</p>
      <p>But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed
         of no hope or consolation</p>
      <p>But I—I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the misery that I then endured.</p>
      <p> died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight
         of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled
         from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit</p>
      <p>I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when I should
         put them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was blasted:
         instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past
         with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized
         by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures,
         such as no language can describe.</p>
      <p>Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself
         from his view.</p>
      <p>But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering , whom I tenderly
         loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and
         surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected
         to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>
      <p>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only
         that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse
         extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in
         daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness</p>
      <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect,
         was the true murderer.</p>
      <p>I often suffered my mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection.
         At other times I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget them,
         the world, and, more than all, myself. When at a distance, I alighted, and threw myself
         on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.</p>
      <p>Why do you call to my remembrance circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that
         I have been the miserable origin and author?</p>
      <p>I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits</p>
      <p>I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted
         me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as
         mortal as that of crime.</p>
      <p>the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes</p>
      <p>I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.</p>
      <p>I, for the first time, saw clearly.</p>
      <p>I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime</p>
      <p>I called myself the murderer of , of , and of .</p>
      <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
         forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes
         of their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in
         the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!
         Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like
         the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture.</p>
      <p>I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror</p>
      <p>but my general state of feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome a residence
         as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms
         of anguish and despair.</p>
      <p>they all died by my hands.</p>
      <p>but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there
         is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.</p>
      <p>often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes</p>
      <p>remorse and guilt</p>
